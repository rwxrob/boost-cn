# Cloud-Native Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

The *Cloud-Native Boost* is meant to launch technologists who have
finished the [Beginner Boost] into the cloud-native technology space
both as administrators and application developers. (We prefer the title
*Cloud-Native Engineer* to combine them both.)

[Beginner Boost]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/boost>

Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a living
document; it changes from day to day --- even hour to hour --- like
software. In fact, knowledge source is actually very similar to source
code and works well in source management systems like Git and GitHub.

> You may want to *Watch* it to be notified of updates and
changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you want to contribute open
an *Issue* to discuss it.

> For raw content development see the [Zettelkasten register](/reg/) instead.
